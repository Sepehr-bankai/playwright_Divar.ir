# First Attempt: Web Scraping with Playwright

This is my **first attempt** at building a web scraping script using Playwright.  
I'm just getting started and this project is in its **very early stages** â€” things will likely change a lot as I learn more and improve it.

---

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

Currently, there's just two main script:

- `first_attempt.py`: My initial version of the scraper.(deleted)
- `second(fixed)prototype`: My Last version of the scraper which was successful.
- i have to add that there is a Folder called Districts, which has a .py that would help you gather districts and use it for the main script:).
- there is a File which you can use to clean the dataset that you Scraped.
## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- The script is optimized and organized into modules.
- I aim to add features, improve code quality, and explore better architecture as I learn.

## âœ¨ Goals

- Learn how to use Playwright with Python.
- Improve my scraping logic, selectors, and data extraction.
- I actually wanted to gather real data based on real events so that i could practice better and real.
- Eventually turn this into a modular and flexible tool with options and arguments.(new update, i did it after 1 day)
