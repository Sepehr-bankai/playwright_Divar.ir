# First Attempt: Web Scraping with Playwright

This is my **first attempt** at building a web scraping script using Playwright.  
I'm just getting started and this project is in its **very early stages** â€” things will likely change a lot as I learn more and improve it.

---

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

Currently, there's just one main script:

- `first_attempt.py`: My initial version of the scraper.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- The script is not yet optimized or organized into modules.
- There are no external folders or files yet, but that might change in the future.
- I aim to add features, improve code quality, and explore better architecture as I learn.

## âœ¨ Goals

- Learn how to use Playwright with Python.
- Improve my scraping logic, selectors, and data extraction.
- Eventually turn this into a modular and flexible tool with options and arguments.
